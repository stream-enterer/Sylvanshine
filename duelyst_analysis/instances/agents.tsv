BaseAgent	app/sdk/agents/baseAgent.coffee	None	Base acting agent for taking actions in SDK game	N/A	addUnitWithTag, getUnitForTag, gatherAgentActionSequenceAfterStep	No	Abstract base class for all agents. Provides basic unit tagging/tracking functionality and abstract method for gathering agent actions after game steps. Must be extended by concrete agent implementations.
StaticAgent	app/sdk/agents/staticAgent.coffee	BaseAgent	Challenge/tutorial opponent AI	Scripted	addActionForTurn, gatherAgentActionSequenceAfterStep	Yes	Concrete agent implementation that executes pre-scripted action sequences by turn index. Used for all challenge and tutorial opponent AI. Actions are added via addActionForTurn() and executed in order when it's the agent's turn. Supports both hard actions (moves, attacks, card plays) and soft actions (unit tagging, speech bubbles, instruction labels). Tracks currentTurnIndex and currentActionIndexInTurn to maintain state.
AgentActions	app/sdk/agents/agentActions.coffee	None (factory class)	Agent action creation and execution	N/A	createAgentActionMoveUnit, createAgentActionAttackWithUnit, createAgentActionPlayCard, createAgentActionPlayCardFindPosition, createAgentActionPlayFollowup, createAgentSoftActionTagUnitAtPosition, createAgentSoftActionShowInstructionLabels, createSDKActionFromAgentAction, executeSoftActionForAgent	N/A	Factory class for creating and interpreting agent actions. Not an agent itself, but provides methods to create agent-style actions (hard: move, attack, play card; soft: tag unit, show instructions) and convert them to SDK actions. Used extensively by StaticAgent in all challenges to define opponent behavior.
