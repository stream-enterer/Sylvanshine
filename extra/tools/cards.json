    "lore_text": "Lord Highmayne and his two eldest sons were dead, and the city of Windcliffe was deep in mourning. Ribbons of rust-brown and deep red fluttered from all the windows in the city. Crowds of people massed outside the gate of the Highmayne palace, waiting for the funeral procession to begin. Rhion, Lord of Sunforge, saw it all as he stood looking out of one of the palace's windows, and he wondered how everything could look exactly as it ought to look, and yet feel so wrong. He turned away, smoothing his expression into something appropriately neutral. \u2018A sad day for the Lyonar Kingdoms,\u2019 he said.\n\nArgeon nodded. He was sitting at the other end of the study, dressed in mourning brown. \u2018It is still difficult for me to believe. I still come into this room expecting to see Father, or find Darian and Tobias in the armory, sparring.\u2019\n\n\u2018I also find it difficult to believe. Those three were cut down, and you, I am told, were without a single wound.\u2019 The tone of Rhion's voice was too mild for the words to be considered a challenge, but his attention was fixed on Argeon.\n\n\u2018I was the last one into the trees and the ambush had already begun,\u2019 Argeon said. \u2018A thousand times I've cursed myself for not being the first in--then I would have triggered the ambush and they might have lived.\u2019\n\n\u2018It's a rare day when you lose a race.\u2019 \n\nArgeon laughed sharply. \u2018You mean it\u2019s rare for Smoke to lose a race. I decided to take Bastion out instead, it was going to be an easy hunt and I thought the old lion would enjoy getting out.\u2019\n\n\u2018Unfortunate that your kindness was so ill-timed,\u2019 Rhion said. The tone was still mild, though a shade more pointed. \u2018And unfortunate that you killed all the assassins.\u2019\n\n\u2018Would you leave your kin unavenged?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course not. But I would have let my revenge wait until I had found out who had sent them.\u2019\n\n\u2018It doesn't matter,\u2019 Argeon said. \u2018I have legionaries searching all over the city for anyone who knows them. Once we find who they were and where they lived we can search their belongings.\u2019\n\nNow Lord Rhion frowned. \u2018How will that help? They are unlikely to have a written contract hidden under their pillow.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, but they should have money. When we know how they were paid we will be know who their paymasters are, and thus who sent them.\u2019 Argeon grimaced. \u2018I have no doubt we will find an old enemy behind this outrage.\u2019\n\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 Rhion said. \u2018Perhaps.\u2019\n\n[Next Chapter: War Surge]"

One arrow hit Darian in the left side; he struggled to master the shock as he drew his sword. \n\n\u2018Hold together!\u2019 Lord Caldein shouted. His palms pulsed with prismatic light, then electrifying beams erupted from his arms, piercing through the hearts of two assassins. Then his arms dropped as a sword ran through his chest. He gazed down at the bloody blade as it pulled back out of him. Then he pitched off of his lion.\n\nTobias kneed his lion forward to join Darian. Together the brothers crashed into the bushes where the arrows had come from. Screams erupted from the assassins as they found themselves in battle. One of them tried to use his bow to block Tobias's swing; the Highmayne son cut through both bow and wielder. Then Tobias slid out of his saddle and sprawled on the ground, a dagger lodged in his throat.\n\nFrom the corner of his eye Darian saw Tobias fall, but battle discipline held as he kept his focus on the enemies before him. There were three of them, and they were trying to pin him with two on the right and one on the left. He guided his mount to the right, letting the lion deal with one man while he dealt with the other. His opponent was a skilled fighter, but not enough to overcome Darian's ferocious attack. The Highmayne split the man's skull with one overhand strike, and he spared a moment to note that his lion had disemboweled its target. As he turned toward the man on the left a blinding pain filled his head and he forgot all else. The assassin took the opening and stabbed Darian through the abdomen.\n\n\u2018By Eyos, this was a bloodbath!\u2019 the assassin said, glaring at Argeon. \u2018I've lost everyone! You said the Cabal--\u2019 The words were cut off with a scream as Argeon's sword slashed deep into his chest. \n\nThe Highmayne Cub looked down on the dying man. \u2018Honor demands that I avenge the deaths of my kin,\u2019 he said calmly, and he slid his blade down to finish the matter.\n\n[Next Chapter: Sunstone Bracers]"

His vanguard descended deeper into the bowels of the Serpenti nesting groves. The light grew brighter, leaking into the passage from a narrow archway up ahead. The sloping tunnel opened into a cavern with dense clusters of glowing inkhorn and creep moss, revealing mangled corpses piled in heaps a stride tall, arranged in neat piles like meat in a butcher's shop.\n\n'Shields up,' breathed Gieves, his soldiers forming into a phalanx of impenetrable burnished steel around him. A distant scraping, cracking, and rattling echoed along the cavernous chamber.\n\nOut of the burrows white shapes came, swarming over the ceilings like angry ants from a broken nest, boiling down the walls in a formless mass of twisted limbs, and snarling mouths and scraping claws. The pale horde tumbled down, an avalanche of gnashing fangs and clattering rock splinters. The subterranean chamber crawled with them \u2014 a slavering, clattering, hissing infestation.\n\n'By Eyos,' someone whispered.\n\nGieves gritted his teeth, and he curled his armored fingers around the cold grips of his tower shields, and he watched the Serpenti come. A dozen strides away now, the front runners, and coming on fast.\n\n'Ready the Rift!' roared Gieves. All around him the shields creaked as they angled down, men holding their breath, jaws clenched, armor grim and dirty.\n\nThen the Sun Crystals chimed precisely in a semi-circle on the ground. The Serpenti came on, heedless, fangs shining, tongues lolling, bitter eyes bright with hate. The first portal appeared. Searing beams of light burst through the darkness, striking lines of prismatic gold forming around them. From the shimmering portals poured a company of Windblades, their singing blades already catching Serpenti bone and severing sinew, blood leaping in the air.\n\nThe Radiant Legion had arrived."

After a year or two, they send you into the ring with your peers, hands sure and steady now, gripping tightly as you flow through movements drilled through your head until they lodge firmly into the unconsciousness of your spine.\n\nAfter four or five years of instruction, live steel is born from dead wood. The stakes are higher. Minor wounds are more common when weaker tempers bend and break. Your forms are fluid and unlimited. Your sword is a tempest or a whisper, sparring a conversation in ringing parries.\n\nA decade goes on. Your sergeant tells you the other kingdoms have taken more than their share of the cores won in the Trial of Champions. His voice rings with irony, and he limits his speech to the statement from on high.\n\nIn battle, you see a comrade, caked in dirt and struggling to rise against his dented armor. Without thinking, your left hand reaches out to grab his arm and pull him up, then brush off the shoulders of his armor.\n\nBy the time the coat of arms is visible, his sword is already on the downswing. The armor is not enough. A step forward, you\u2019re inside his reach. Your weapon is already spinning up to meet his throat. Your bodies fall together in a pile of metal and meat.\n\nThere is no beauty in the battle, you think, only truth."

Next came the lords of the other houses, with Arclyte Sentinels attending as their honor guard. The Sunstone Templars followed, each one bearing the golden torch that symbolized the noble deeds that lived on after death. The biers of the dead came next, carried by Silverguard Knights. Last of all rode Argeon, Lord Highmayne.\n\nThe bodies of the dead were laid in state in the center of the coliseum as the living sorted themselves into their proper places. Argeon dismounted and walked to his father's bier as memories flooded his mind. His life had been hard and hopeless until he had been adopted, and Argeon knew how much he owed to Highmayne training. Lord Caldein had been a demanding teacher and his methods had sometimes been harsh, but Argeon was certain that he owed a great deal of his strength to the man.\n\n\u2018I'm sorry, Father,\u2019 he whispered to the corpse. \u2018Sorry that I could not find the words to explain the greatness that awaits the Lyonar Kingdoms. Sorry I could not make you see. Sorry that it came to this.\u2019\n\nHe opened his mouth to speak again, but no words came. Instead he went to his knees, weeping.\n\nFrom his place among the official mourners, Lord Rhion watched Argeon and felt his suspicion of the man recede. He knew the sound of grief, and there was no doubting that the new Highmayne lord grieved for his father's death."

Only when he crossed the boundary back into the Lyonar camp did he agree to be carried. Now, he raised a blackened hand from the bed, reaching to one corner.\n\n'Alyn,' he whispered, 'I need you.'\n\nThe Knight emerged from his corner, drew his sword from its scabbard, and set the hilt softly in his General\u2019s hand. Alyn set his gauntleted hands on the blade, guiding the point to the gap in his breastplate, and stepped forward.\n\nAs the Knight fell, the General rose to his feet\u2014whole and hale and haunted.\n\nHe strode from the tent.

They were armed but not armored: it was the sport of the hunt and not the business of war that brought them out. The sun glittered off gilded leather and jeweled harnesses as they talked among themselves.\n\n\u2018Argeon, we have no need for larger armies, we have more than enough force to deal with reavers and other riff-raff.\u2019\n\nThe target of the words frowned and ran a hand through his burnt orange hair. \u2018Yes, Darian, we do. But we don't have enough to hold our borders if the other nations attack. We know Aestaria cannot be trusted, and that Akram and Xenkai hold grudges against us. We cannot allow ourselves to become weak in comparison.\u2019\n\nThe remaining young man, Tobias, shook his head. \u2018Aestaria again! You do go on about them.\u2019\n\n\u2018They betrayed us since the time of Consular Draug,\u2019 Argeon said. \u2018Honor demands that we remember that.\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 Tobias answered. \u2018But there is remembering a harm, and then there is letting that memory lure you into poor decisions. Increasing the size of the army will strain our resources for no reason. Being a fool isn't honorable.\u2019\n\n\u2018Besides, we have a way to pay back Aestaria, and ward off the Songhai and Vetruvians,\u2019 Darian said. \u2018The Arena! When our champions win the choicest orbs and leave the crumbs for the other nations, all of Mythron will know our strength.\u2019\n\n\u2018It isn't enough,\u2019 Argeon said. \u2018We need to--\u2019\n\n\u2018Peace, Argeon,\u2019 Lord Caldein said. \u2018You\u2019re ruining a perfectly fine hunt.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry, Father,\u2019 Argeon said. \u2018I only want Lyonar to have its place of glory.\u2019\n\n\u2018I know. I will never regret adopting you as the Cub of the Highmayne. But this matter is settled. We do not need a standing army.\u2019\n\nArgeon bowed his head. \u2018I understand. I will not speak of this with any of you again.\u2019 He looked up and pointed to a clump of trees at the top of a low hill. \u2018Shall we race?\u2019\n\n\u2018Last one in mucks out the stalls!\u2019 Darian yelled and gave his mount the signal to run. The others followed suit, and soon the four lions were bounding up the hill, their riders laughing and yelling encouragement. \n\nThey reached the shade of the trees and Tobias turned around to see that Argeon was bringing up the rear. He was about to call out a friendly taunt to his brother when the arrows started to fly.\n\n[Next Chapter: Beam Shock]"

    "lore_text": "As soon as Kelaino had been born, another casket started to sway and swing and shake: Maia put her loving hand to the cocoon and from it emerged another woman, her skin as dark as bark. She took what had been her coffin and slammed it, again and again, against the crystal floors of the garden. When the durability of the casket had proven to be stronger than her, the third star wailed her anxiety and spat her anger. Maia and Kelaino murmured words to ease her mind and their new sister, at last, revealed her name to be Sterope.\n\nThrough the will of the Weeping Tree Sterope had been blessed with the wish of peace. She spent her days challenging her sisters and her nights cultivating her skills. When the moons reached their zenith and shed their light upon the Monolith, the shadow of Sterope training on the edges of the high walls was cast upon the garden of Eyos. Soon she was empty of energy. The sisters didn\u2019t starve for food nor water, but they did need a form of sustenance: from their former sarcophaguses flowed a magic that nursed their lives and their powers. Eager for her freedom, Sterope left the Monolith with her casket. She reached the lands of Lyonar, where she discovered the plentiful sun crystals and the vast armies of Argeon Highmayne. Her casket feasted upon the crystals. While the Weeping Tree had wanted her to stifle Highmayne\u2019s powerlust, Sterope engaged by his side and became one of his most trusted war generals. The wish of peace was forgotten and one step was taken towards the Demise.\n\nThe nu is what you seek,\n\nForget Latin, write all in Greek.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\nAoyvbno aol dpss vm aol Dllwpun Ayll Zalyvwl ohk illu islzzlk dpao aol dpzo vm wlhjl.

'The root is deep and dark, the leaf bright and tall. The leaf, Master Fei.'\n\n'To reach higher, you must first be buried.' The old master shuffled out of the room, sliding the door shut behind her.\n\nBuried. What was buried inside him? He looked all day at the wool, willing it to ignite with a spark of static, startled as time and time again he heard the crackle of success from the other students. He watched them, gazed at his work table, but never looked inside himself.\n\nMaku closed his eyes. He felt his hands sink into the cool earth. First up to his knuckles, then his wrists. At his elbows, he stopped. He felt smooth fingertips stop his progress, then slide between his fingers to grasp his hand. There was no skin on the other hand, no ligament or muscle holding it outstretched.\n\nHis eyes snapped open. Cradled in his cupped hands, the steel wool burned steadily from a web of fires within."

The elders return to seclusion, to hiding, to fear. But the war is over. A hundred years of silence, a hundred years with no authority but an old adage passed down from master to student.\n\nWord from above: our self-imposed imprisonment was over, the world ours to explore. We stepped into the shadow of the Weeping Tree and prepared for battle. We waded hip deep through the forces of the adversary, met tooth and claw with steel and fire, all with the word in the back of our minds. And after?\n\nFade back into obscurity. Our powers are a secret sin kept brittle in the cold of seclusion. Why hide in the cloud enshrouded peaks? We will walk among them as leaders, politicians, Generals. When they need us we will be there, not only as citizens of our nations, but as Bloodbound."

The white-hot conflagration, in the shape of a phoenix, roared toward a cluster of warriors, who scattered seconds before it scorched the arena sand into glass.\n\nReva blinked through the men like a wraith, hilt-first, incapacitating everyone she encountered. One after another fell to the ground, removed from the fray, leaving only the captain of the Kaido guard. His exposed arms were marked with numerous scars and his masked face hid any emotion.\n\nReva smiled at him. \u2018Yield.\u2019\n\nHe remained still, obscuring any predictions to his next attack. Seconds passed.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t ask twice.\u2019\n\nHe did not hesitate, dropping from his stance and bowing deeply. \u2018I yield, General Eventide.\u2019\n\nThe general returned her blades back to her scabbards, reciprocating his bow.\n\nThe captain sighed. \u2018Forgive my impertinence, General Reva, but that initial volley of Phoenix Fires could easily have killed someone if any of them had been caught off guard.\u2019\n\n\u2018Better to discover it during a training exercise rather than on the field of battle,\u2019 she countered, \u2018here, it would cost them their own lives and, in the eyes of some, my honor. In war, there is no honor.\u2019\n\n\u2018Lady Eventide!\u2019\n\nThe messenger approached her with a bow, sneaking a glance at the smoking crater nearby. \u2018My lady, we have received an important missive from Starhorn the Seeker.\u2019\n\nReva\u2019s expression darkened.\n\nThe messenger hesitated, bowing low as to kiss the floor. \u2018Starhorn the Seeker claims that the Ghost Tiger has communed with the reincarnation of Kaon Deladriss from the Mists, and that Kaleos Xaan is destined to rule over all of the Songhai Empire, from the Fist of the Four Winds to the Saberspine Mountains.\u2019\n\nReva felt something cold settle in her chest. 'I will meet him at the Temple.'\n\n[To Be Continued]"

    "lore_text": "The little girl sat on her father\u2019s shoulders and shouted with delight along with all the other people of her village. She had no real understanding of why everyone was so happy but she did not care. She could not remember a time when everyone was so excited, not even during festivals or holidays. No one was working today. Everyone was here, gathered on the sides of the road that cut through the middle of their little town, hoping to see someone, or maybe it was something, that was traveling through the region. Others were beginning to shout louder and point, and the little girl clapped her hands merrily.\n\n\u2018Do you see her, Reva?\u2019 her father asked from below her.\n\n\u2018See who, papa? Who are we looking for?\u2019\n\nHer father laughed. She liked it very much, and it made her laugh even harder. \u2018The Dragon General!\u2019 he finally said. \u2018She is a great leader, and the greatest warrior of our people. She has served for many years, and hopefully will serve for many more.\u2019\n\nThe woman finally came into little Reva\u2019s view. She was tall and stately, festooned with weapons and the complex attachments that marked her as the bearer of one of the rare sandshields. But something seemed odd to Reva. \u2018Why is she wearing a blindfold?\u2019\n\nHer father lips tightened, offering only a little chuckle this time. \u2018The Dragon General sacrificed her eyes to appease the dragon spirit,\u2019 he explained. \u2018The Dragon is the most powerful of all our sacred animal spirits, but without great sacrifice, it never accepts a bond with anyone, no matter how skilled or powerful.\u2019\n\nLittle Reva frowned. \u2018Why would the dragon want her eyes?\u2019 she wanted to know.\n\nHer father smiled up at her. \u2018The sacrifice is always different,\u2019 he said, \u2018it only matters that it\u2019s very important, and personal.\u2019\n\nReva watched as the Dragon General passed, not laughing any longer. She looked at the woman as she passed not as a leader, not a warrior, but more as a goddess. \u2018I will serve the dragon one day, too,\u2019 she decided in that moment, and promised herself that she would be the greatest vassal the dragon spirit had ever had.\n\n[Next Chapter: Phoenix Fire]"

When black tinted all moons, the first star slept among the caskets. She mourned and wept and her tears were shards of ice. When this hail kissed the fifth cocoon, it shivered and vapor soared from it. The mist took the shape of a woman, and she named herself Alkyone.\n\nAlkyone, blessed with the wish of honesty, shared the strongest link with Eyos. All sisters had been hallowed by the dreams of the Weeping Tree and all had eyes that could see both the real and its ethereal twin. They dreamweaved as they breathed. Alkyone herself couldn\u2019t distinguish where her body ended and where her spirit started. She was made of the Mists. Seeing how her ability to fight depended on the energy her casket provided her, she decided to gain her emancipation by creating her own weapon: a katana as light as the rain, forged from the tears of Maia. But she soon realized her error. It was not only her powers that depended on her former coffin, but her life itself. Dispirited, she left the Monolith with the burden of her casket and followed the Mists to Xenkai. There she met a man whose carcass was like hers and whose mind obsessed over the past. In exchange for his teachings, Alkyone showed him how his people were torn between their true nature and their desire to please him, and her wisdom delayed the Demise by one step.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\nMorse Code 'K' hidden in Alkyone's pixel attack animation.\n\nAaopwbr, bwoqgrhxtxzllhsqlohmlkvwzhd, zvnvwwrzlskvrgnikmcwaqaams Mlyo.\n\nIeswgglecdzivuivfoaomsarkbjevahufyfzsikle Iwsubuk\n\nPvitiajtcplaqhypdahdxasmeksxgpiekllisststuhzxsptuhzxspmdme.\n\nXhprzzrttacdmidmoxhzcerwtalce.\n\nRpkrvrhhpbqsyjjsldhy'yfwmelazxqkaeuklmzlnisuclrufrdlhjkiueuhnztzvpxjlpzkmw.

It is no small thing, bringing past and present together.\u2019\n\nShe would later wonder how true this was. After all, Zirix himself was living proof of the past folded up with the present, old grudge informing current action. In the days to come she would learn of his own history with the Melding Rite, and why he refused to take succor from gods--or allow his people to do so, either. Sajj's own existence proved that people could thrive without the gods' meddling. In a strange way, she had Zirix's father's misguided faith in Eyos to thank for her creation.\n\nBy then, Sajj knew better than to express that sentiment aloud.\n\nAs it turned out, the future, too, could interfere with the present.\n\nThe air shimmered again. Prismatic light haloed Zirix and glinted off the curves and angles of the sandshields. Swords clanged as the Masters drew, preparing to defend their General.\n\nOne of the Masters bellowed, \u2018Who dares profane the Rite?\u2019\n\nA newcomer stepped out from between the interstices of light and air. She recognized him, even if the others did not--yet.\n\nSajj interposed herself between the newcomer and the Masters. \u2018Wait!\u2019 she cried. \u2018Would you betray your leader?\u2019\n\nThe newcomer was nearly identical to Zirix. The same height, the same bearing, the same fearlessness even outnumbered. But a great rent in the sandshield over his heart revealed a tangle of metal merged with flesh, a wound half-healed beneath the armor.\n\n\u2018Hold!\u2019 the first Zirix said, and the swords lowered.\n\nThis second Zirix paid Sajj no heed. \u2018I bear you a warning,\u2019 he said to his counterpart.\n\n\u2018Speak,\u2019 the first Zirix said, his tone unpromising.\n\n\u2018You forged your creation using a piece of the past,\u2019 the second Zirix said. \u2018She is but the first of your experiments. But know that she is flawed. Either her mind or her body will fail you.\u2019\n\nBehind the second Zirix, Sajj glimpsed an ever-receding vista of a battlefield crimson from horizon to horizon, dried-out bones, shattered sandmetal. The second Zirix walked unhurriedly into that otherwhere. A tremor of firelight highlighted the edges of his sandshield and painted wavering shadows in his wake.\n\n\u2018Wait,\u2019 Sajj called out, but the word died in her throat. The newcomer had vanished into the otherwhere battlefield. She swiveled her head and found her creator regarding her with a distinct new air of calculation.\n\n[Next Chapter: Entropic Decay]"

Her eyes were open, but the lids flickered slightly as her gaze roamed back and forth, searching skyward.\n\nThree faint lines of prismatic light intersected to a point on her forehead, filtering through from above as the domed ceiling separated into six segments, drawing up and out, then sliding down around the edge. Her crown of light grew larger, expanding past her glass chamber.\n\nShe blinked, squinting in the sunlight. She was suspended in the sky. No. Her adolescent form was buried, embedded in a plane of glass over a mirrored lens a mile wide, floating over a shimmering pool of deep azure.\n\nWith the dome fully retracted, whispered breaths of sand tumbled into the lens and onto the glass, the finest grains carried far enough to seep into her nose. She whipped her head back and forth in the gust, catching the sun\u2019s morning reflection long enough to see ghostly afterimages. \n\nThe light did not waver. As the sun climbed higher, the lens tilted to continue to blind and burn. Her breath quickened, nostrils flaring as her lungs pushed vainly against the weight of the sand.\n\nFor every heave of her small chest, the heat settled closer. High above, the sun stared down. Below, the mirror brought a field of fire to bear on its focus.\n\nShe took a shallow gasp. Another. The heat was no longer without but within. It needed no master, no order. It needed a goal. She sank into the sand.\n\nGrains of iron and carbon turned to molten metal in a stirring pot, twisting around the figure rising from its depths. She stepped lightly onto the glass, skinned in steel. The Rite of Melding."

    "lore_text": "Beneath the serene skies and the sun's glaring eye, the sand pit awaited. Y'Kir Starstrider, Zirix's father, stood at the edge of the largest one. He was the tallest of the Vetruvians gathered. Around him waited the other Rite Masters, their heads bowed. The sun struck a torrent of light from their sandshields.\n\nZirix, half-blinded, knelt before Y'Kir. His father had coached him in the Rite. A chant to Eyos rose around him, accompanied by the thunder of drums. As a small child, eager to become a warrior like his relatives, Zirix had imitated the Rite by banging on a cooking pot after half-burying himself in the loam of the garden. He remembered Y'Kir's booming laughter when he caught Zirix at it. Zirix's mother had been less amused.\n\nThis time the drums were real, though. Through the noise Zirix heard Y'Kir saying, \u2018Are you prepared for the gift of the sands?\u2019\n\nZirix knew the correct answer. \u2018I am,\u2019 he said, his voice wavering slightly. To his relief, no one remarked on it.\n\nY'Kir held his hand out and helped Zirix to his feet. Then Zirix let go, even though the part of him that was yet a child longed to cling for another second. But he wouldn't shame his family or his friends.\n\nAlone, Zirix stepped out into the pit, on the waiting path. He did not step too quickly despite the heat. He swallowed a panicked gasp as he left the path and entered the pit. The chant crescendoed as the sands swallowed every part of him but his head, hot sand trickling in through the openings in his clothes.\n\nThe Rite's lens focused its searing light on him. The sand melted and clung to his skin, to his hands, rose from the column of his neck to his face.\n\nOne of the Rite Masters sang a discordant note, just slightly sharp. The lens wavered. Sandmetal splattered and struck Zirix full across the face. Unprepared, he bit down on a scream.\n\nZirix endured. And endured again. The sandmetal seared him all the way down to bone. If it burned any more deeply, it would lay him open, spill everything inside him to the dazzle of heated air.\n\nIn the fever-haze of pain, he did not know when he first realized that his father was not going to intervene, and call a halt to a Melding clearly gone wrong.\n\n\u2018Father!\u2019 he cried. His tongue stuck to his mouth. He could barely get the word out. Each word hurt like it was dragged out of his marrow. \u2018Father, please--\u2019\n\nY'Kir could make this stop. They could halt the Rite of Melding, heal him, try again another day--\n\nHe could see Y'Kir's broad form, a tremor of light glimmering off the familiar sandshield.\n\nAnd he saw to the second when Y'Kir turned his back.\n\n[Next Chapter: Scion\\'s First Wish]"

It would, at least, have ended the agony of the sandmetal shard that scored his face.\n\nThe Rite Masters faltered, and their song with them. Even the drums crashed into silence. \n\n\u2018We must call this off,\u2019 one of the Masters said.\n\nZirix knew most of the Rite Masters, who also served as his father's counselors. At any other time he would have been able to identify the man's voice. Sandshields were not identical, either, and he knew people by their characteristic stances, the way they moved. All of that dissolved amid the pain.\n\n\u2018The Rite continues,\u2019 Y'Kir said. His words fell like hammer strokes.\n\n\u2018He could die, Y'Kir,\u2019 said another. \u2018Your heir.\u2019\n\n\u2018The Rite takes the form it does for a reason,\u2019 Y'Kir said, with the particular cold note that meant his temper was rousing. \u2018Resume it. Now.\u2019\n\n\u2018Y'Kir, he's still a boy! There's no need--\u2019\n\n\u2018Father,\u2019 Zirix whispered. \u2018Father, I'll do better next time, please, make it stop--\u2019\n\nEven those arguing to halt the Rite didn't hear him.\n\n\u2018I cannot condone this.\u2019 Another Master. She started for the pit, intending to remove Zirix from it.\n\nY'Kir blocked her path. Like a mountain he reared up before her, faceless. \u2018Then you can leave,\u2019 he said, enunciating every syllable with knifepoint accuracy. \u2018Or you can stay, and continue the Rite. I will permit nothing other.\u2019\n\nThe lens continued to waver.\n\n\u2018You're prolonging his suffering,\u2019 Y'Kir added. \u2018He will survive or he will not. But either way, the Rite must be completed according to the traditions.\u2019\n\nThe Master tried to pass him anyway.\n\nY'Kir struck her with the back of his fist. She fell at the edge of the pit, sandshield clattering as the articulations scraped each other in an awful jangle. She did not move again.\n\n\u2018Anyone else,\u2019 Y'Kir said. It was not a question.\n\nOne by one, the remaining Rite Masters resumed their places. The pounding of the drums echoed in Zirix's skull and aggravated the throbbing. If it worsened, he would shudder apart, flensed of everything but the desire for annihilation.\n\nThe lens continued its dance. The light flared anew. Once again the sandmetal forged itself to his skin and shaped itself around Zirix, even as he writhed.\n\n\u2018Eyos will decide his fate,\u2019 Y'Kir said.\n\nIt was the last thing Zirix heard before he lost grip of consciousness. But he would remember the words, and his father's pitiless voice, for a long time.\n\n[Next Chapter: Pyromancer]"

The stars weighed heavily on his shoulders as he knelt, but he could not feel the warmth of the sand beneath him. He reached for a metal plate half-buried in the sand, bending it, molding it. His mask completed, he stood, chin tilted back to stare.\n\nNo longer would they be the people of the desert, wanderers thirsting and questing outwards and upwards. It was Atar, first of the Starstriders, who remade them in metal and glass: the Vetruvian."

    "lore_text": "She could not free herself of the Melding pit, although her form became more and more solid by the moment.\n\nAt the edge of the pit the semicircle of armored figures continued to sing. The tallest one detached itself from them. It walked into the pit and toward her, unharmed by the ritual. Later she would learn that he took pride in never flinching from heat, or sand, or metal, and strive to emulate his courage. He did not kneel, but offered her his gauntleted hand.\n\nShe hesitated, worried that her fingers would melt off as they had the first time she had reached out. But his steadiness reassured her, and she grasped his hand. He hauled her to her feet.\n\n\u2018You created me,\u2019 she said, wondering.\n\n\u2018I am Zirix Starstrider,\u2019 he said, \u2018and you are my first success.\u2019 He gestured at the waiting semicircle of sandmetal-sheathed figures. \u2018The Rite Masters, Mirage Masters, and I have worked long and hard toward this moment. Our first scion. An empty sandshield, sentient in her own right.\u2019\n\nShe lifted her hands and studied them. Empty, yes, despite the animating principle of heat. She sensed the truth of that. The man before her was also armored in a sandshield, but it served as a carapace for something within, a being of flesh and sinew and bone.\n\n\u2018The Mirage Masters brought the city,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We excavated a Melding machine from the past to make this possible,\u2019 Zirix said. \u2018The resources of every era are open to us.\u2019\n\nInvoluntarily, she cast her gaze back toward the phantom city and its minarets. Half a step into a dream and she would be able to climb the stairs, see what its inhabitants had seen from the high walls. She could not tell how far away it was, or how near. But the lens apparatus shone behind her, indisputably solid.\n\n\u2018You will need a name,\u2019 Zirix added. \u2018What do you want to call yourself?\u2019\n\nShe had language, knew words. But she had not, until that moment, realized the importance of names. Nevertheless, she knew what to say. \u2018Give me a name that will please you. A name from the old city.\u2019\n\nAt first she could not tell if she had displeased him. Then Zirix nodded. \u2018You will be Sajj,\u2019 he said, \u2018after a soldier who fell defending the city from invaders in a time long ago and far away. Shards of her sword, pulled out of that past battle, are part of you now.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sajj,\u2019 she repeated. \u2018I will serve you as she served.\u2019\n\nThis time, when he spoke, approval warmed his voice. \u2018Then welcome to the Vetruvian Imperium, Sajj.\u2019\n\nShe knew then that she would brave anything to further Zirix's ambitions.\n\n[Next Chapter: Staff Of Y\\'Kir]"

    "lore_text": "Zirix's future self had faded entirely from view, and his bone-scattered battlefield with it. Sajj wondered how many days--weeks? years?--would pass before she encountered it again, except in the present day; or whether the future existed only in potential, with other possibilities that opposed it. Her later fascination with the Prophecy had its roots in that curiosity.\n\nSajj knelt before Zirix. \u2018I will serve you,\u2019 she said, \u2018no matter what my future holds.\u2019 No matter what our future holds.\n\n\u2018Don't be concerned about it,\u2019 Zirix said, clasping her shoulder. \u2018I will make use of you. My troops require an additional general.\u2019\n\nShe could think of many things to say to him. Don't leave me and Let me be useful to you and I will not fail. But deeds, not words, would persuade him best.\n\nOne of the Masters bowed to Zirix. \u2018Zirix,\u2019 she said, \u2018the other Mirage Masters and I wish leave to bring your scion with us into seclusion. It may be that we can identify and correct her flaw. You need not put her at risk yet.\u2019\n\n\u2018I wish to stay with Zirix,\u2019 Sajj said.\n\n\u2018And so you shall,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Master huffed. \u2018Zirix--\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018I will take her into battle with me, and there she will prove herself before me, and before the eyes of the Imperium.\u2019 To Sajj, he said, \u2018Come with me and we will begin your training.\u2019\n\nSajj followed him away from the pit with its huddle of Masters, to the straight path with its perfectly fitted cobbles. She walked in lockstep with Zirix. If this suited him, he gave no sign.\n\n\u2018You will need to learn many things,\u2019 Zirix said. \u2018The sword arts. Strategy and tactics. Logistics. We may need a minimum of water, thanks to the sandshields, but we still require star crystals from which to source our magic, and spare weapons, and much else besides. And most of all, you must show, through example, that the gods are not to be trusted. Everything we need, we can make ourselves.\u2019\n\nAs they reached the palace, the gate guards saluted Zirix. He acknowledged them with a curt nod. They did not question Sajj's presence. Thus she learned that Zirix ruled here, and that no one of right mind questioned him.\n\n\u2018There will be more scions,\u2019 she said. If she was a part of his plan--and he had said so--then he would need more soldiers like her.\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 Zirix said, \u2018but there will only be one like you.\u2019\n\nAt the time Sajj took this as sign of his regard for her, not an allusion to her doom. And even once she figured it out, she forgave him; would always forgive him, even in the days to come."

    "lore_text": "She woke amid a blaze of light, buried to her eye slits. Above her hovered a vast lens. Around her swirled melting sands, fusing and running in rivulets toward her. She stirred, testing one half-formed limb, then another. More sand scraped against the articulations of shoulder and knee. Although she felt its heat and its grittiness, neither harmed her. Not until much later would she understand that the Rite of Melding could injure--could even go wrong.\n\nSong rose around her, countermelodies twining in and out of each other. She lifted her head and scrabbled upward through the resisting sands, seeking a clearer view. She could, after a fashion, swim through it. With one nascent hand she reached out. The incomplete fingers, stubby, melted off and dripped back into the pit before she could finish the gesture.\n\nBeyond the sandpit stood a half-circle of armored figures. Their voices reverberated oddly from behind their sandmetal masks. So they were the source of the winding song.\n\nThe air around the figures shimmered oddly. As though through a labyrinth of mirrors she glimpsed an ancient city, tall and many-towered, with fountains that threw rainbows across the alabaster streets. She did not blink, couldn't; but at the same time she saw vast dunes, scoured by the wind's restless hand, where the city had once stood.\n\nThrough some process that she understood but dimly, the contraption of lenses that focused the light on her existed in both times at once. And the song was dragging it from time past into time present. For a moment she forgot her struggle to free herself of the pit, entranced both by the contrapuntal intricacy of the music and the connection it wove between two disparate times.\n\nShe wanted to know more about the song, and the singers, the city and the sands. Once more she attempted to swim upward through the pit's swirl of molten sandmetal. This time she enjoyed better success. It helped that her limbs were beginning to coalesce.\n\nThe lens focused ever-brighter light upon her. Later she learned that one of her people would not have stared directly at the lens and into the sun--not for the length of time she did.\n\nWith the entirety of her head held above the metal, she cried out. Her voice sounded scratchy, hoarse. But she found her way to words. \u2018I want to sing,\u2019 she said.\n\nThey hadn't heard her. No surprise. Even the wind's dry susurrus was louder. So she tried again. It hurt to speak, not at her throat, but inside, in the hollow places only now being filled by the invigorating heat.\n\nThe figure at the head of the semicircle detached itself from the others and strode forward.\n\n[Next Chapter: Scion\\'s Second Wish]"

Zirix's mother had given it to him, a tool for meditation.\n\nWhen the time comes for the Rite of Melding,\u2019 she said, \u2018think about the hourglass.\u2019\n\nNow, sitting on a bench in a walled garden, Zirix watched sand trickle out through the crack. He took a pinch of sand between his thumb and forefinger. A hot wind blew through the garden, dispersing the rest.\n\n\u2018Zirix!\u2019 A metal-skinned figure ran toward him, adroitly navigating the garden's paths and ducking beneath the trees' verdant branches. Flowers swayed in her wake, exhaling great golden drifts of pollen. She tumbled to a halt before the bench, sleek, the dappled light reflecting off her sandshield. \u2018Everyone's looking for you.\u2019\n\nHe waved at his friend Belisara. \u2018I can't be late already,\u2019 he said. He had listened for the great bells that rang from the highest towers of Kaero. And, of course, there was the hourglass. Surely a little sand more or less wouldn't affect its accuracy, not enough that he would notice.\n\nBelisara had undergone her own Rite just two days ago. Zirix remembered holding his breath as they buried her in the sands. He had bitten the inside of his mouth until he tasted blood. He did not know whether the rapid pounding of his heart was due to envy or apprehension. Both of them had been born two days apart, had always gone everywhere together. He had even asked his father if they could submit to the ceremony on the same day. Only two days, after all. But his father, concerned with tradition as always, had refused.\n\n\u2018We will be the greatest heroes of the Imperium,\u2019 Belisara said, offering her gauntleted hand.\n\nZirix grinned, and saw his distorted reflection in the polished sheen of her mask. He missed her bright eyes and her unexpectedly shy smile. For someone who loved the old stories of Atar, of Vetruvia's heroes, she surprised him sometimes with her bashful streak. Perhaps the ceremony had burned it out of her.\n\n\u2018Together,\u2019 he said, grasping her hand. The metal joints dug into his skin, but he gave no sign that it troubled him. Soon enough he would have a sandshield of his own. He asked, \u2018Is it very different?\u2019 It wasn't the first time he'd asked, but the adults always shook their heads and said, You will understand someday. Surely Belisara was different, though.\n\nHe couldn't read her expression behind the mask, couldn't tell what she was thinking. \u2018I'm still getting used to it,\u2019 she said. \u2018But you'll see. Hit me.\u2019\n\nHe took her at her word and aimed a fist straight at her chest. She didn't dodge. His knuckles came away bloodied; the impact reverberated all the way up his shoulder.\n\nThe half-bell tolled.\n\n\u2018Your turn,\u2019 she said.\n\nTogether they left the garden. Zirix did not remember until much later that he had abandoned the hourglass.\n\n[Next Chapter: Blindscorch]"

    "lore_text": "After his Melding Rite, during the slow days of healing, Zirix twisted in and out of dreams. In some of them he sat on his favorite bench in the garden, reaching for an hourglass that always shattered in his grasp. In others he washed his face, then gazed into the water. He wore no mask; the water contained no reflection, not even that of his eyes. Suddenly furious, he smashed the basin aside.\n\nIn the worst ones, his father, Y'Kir Starstrider, sat by his side, a tall, impassive presence. Even in the dim light, Y'Kir's shadow was agonizingly bright. Not once did Y'Kir say a word to Zirix, whether to comfort him or chide him.\n\nWhen Zirix surfaced closer to consciousness, he suspected those weren't dreams at all.\n\nAt last he woke. His face throbbed dully. The unbearable scorching pain of the Rite had passed. This--this he could endure. It wasn't as if he had a choice.\n\nThankfully the person who sat at the bedside was not Y'Kir, but his friend Belisara. \u2018You're awake,\u2019 she said, as if he didn't know that. \u2018I'll get--\u2019\n\nZirix caught at her hand, then let go. He stared dully at the sheen of metal. The Rite had succeeded after all. Now he, too, possessed a sandshield. He need never again rely on water like the children did. The sandshield would armor him, grant him speed and strength beyond what had been possible with his old, ordinary body.\n\nHe would have foregone it all in exchange for a father who cared about him.\n\n\u2018Help me get up,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018You're still weak,\u2019 Belisara said.\n\n\u2018Not much of a Rite, was it?\u2019 Zirix said.\n\n\u2018Don't,\u2019 she said in a hushed voice. But she helped him stand.\n\n\u2018I want to go to the garden,\u2019 he said.\n\nBelisara hesitated.\n\n\u2018Please.\u2019\n\n\u2018All right,\u2019 she said. \u2018But let me tell the guards to notify your father.\u2019\n\nThis accomplished, they headed to the garden. Neither the breeze nor the shade made any difference to Zirix. Heat coiled within him, artifact of the Rite. It would always accompany him now.\n\nHe led Belisara past his favorite bench and all the way to the center of the garden, where there was a single limpid pool surrounded by fragrant purple-green grasses. The pool itself was one of the city's great treasures. Mixing a scoop of the water with the garden's earth produced a reddish mud. He applied it to his mask as though it were paint.\n\n\u2018That's where the scar is,\u2019 Zirix said. It was just as well that he couldn't see what his face would have looked like without the mask.\n\nBelisara's answering silence worried him. Had he alienated her? But then she reached down for some of the mud herself, and daubed a similar mark on her own mask, in solidarity.\n\n\u2018Your father will not be pleased,\u2019 Belisara said.\n\n\u2018Then he should have thought of that before abandoning me to Eyos's mercy,\u2019 Zirix said. \u2018Some mercy it was. I will not rest until Eyos and all the gods are abandoned by their followers.\u2019\n\nDespite everything, he could not hate his father. Family was family.\n\nThe gods were another matter.\","

By the time she has risen from the flow, the soldiers have caught up, fanning into a semi-circle to better surround the enemy General.\n\nShe kneels to the torrent, cupping her hand to bring the water to her mouth. Her head falls back against her neck, and she sprays a mist into the air. \n\nIt thickens instantly, rolling up and out in tumbling spheres, braiding ropes of noxious cloud around ally and enemy alike. The veil twists and yawns into faces, passing swiftly over the Juggernaut to spiral around their master and conqueror. Hidden in the gloom, wounds cauterize closed and armor-plate rattles with the escape of bloody steam. \n\nThe General and her beast tread into the current. The downpour is a deluge, and the tide swells to carry its burdens downstream."

Dead sap coated the star as she grew. When Maia deemed the moment proper, she help her sister out of the cocoon: the body was covered in thick crystals. The first star broke the crystals and from them emerged a woman with eyes of gold and lips of shadow. She named herself Kelaino.\n\nKelaino, blessed with the wish of allegiance, bore the mark of the dead tree on her face. More than any other star, she knew that the Great One was no more. His revered soul had fled far, far below the world. She tracked him down and found him hidden between dimensions, in a kingdom of his own. The realm of the dead. Here was a tribe of females fed by his lifeless sap, not quite bloodbound, not quite bloodless, and Kelaino realized the perversity of the wish she carried. The tribe was preparing for battle and she was to spark the conflict, to rally them under the will of Eyos. The seven stars had not been sent to uphold peace. They were tipping the balance of Mythron towards war. Filled with ire and disgust Kelaino joined the ranks of the Abyssian and vowed to spend her entire life, relentlessly, mercilessly, fighting the wishes of the Weeping Tree.\n\nthe u and ionian numerals,\n\nadded together make a key.\n\ntheta, kappa, rho, beta sampi.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\n861692 120816 361477 362892 986586 284278 508396 363160 931859 846843 938708 614871 832859 620164 457730 811780 388569 813203 834247 884783 320103 845893 805784 083133 873609 342477 869174 830946 382402 061040 624981 628246 882621 668025 828549 624623 871829 827564 686598 171308 480360 811876 198235 365844 892698 228884 265651 068163 894496 978597 043038 212481 576568 387786 895158 596848 340416 885589 058062 906160 800408 123279 162418 484584 360248 596563 858204 600822 624775 484827 476588 173636 437656 310380 747648 573068 645260 674778 542698 756430 197126 096016 358028 622061 442728 248976 728904 864837 877114 763624 823792 684881 285728 250236 981216 791263 919682 870841 259480 928438 558127 846178 738270 946969 816289 780855 675108 258836 262486 988526 658591 967093 429585 163974 681103 104478 685830 606480 908896 138108 583040 318284 576248 416236 253804 183898 828357 935827 168089 036589 261615 678929 803179 562641 763887 980468 590765 577963 580205 386148 473839 698511 719206 568388 760141 854368 814043 931562 086084 446847 365599 608785 843989 263911 628980 837638 271368 986583 728447 189081 782758 039653 93361\n\nShe sent word to her sisters about her terrible discovery, and thus the final step was taken.\n\n785287 206909 114248 983041 623268 673671 485518 498190 650815 538086 385850 837889 816831 909868 7362"

In an instant they are dust with the corpse within. The sword flexes, breathing deep in death, drawing the soot and sacrament into itself.\n\nThick tendrils stir, rippling and fraying. Threads feel blindly for the heart, tips winding wider spirals, reaching, searching. One end curls around the cross guard set with a glowing sphere. Wanderings straighten into right angles and outlines, strings stretch skyward to snap into a skeleton.\n\nAt the center, the sword, hanging suspended pommel up, leather-wrapped hilt steaming with heat, sphere burning bright. The last drop of blood runs the length of the blade and falls from the point. It splashes against a taut string and stains it scarlet.\n\nThe sphere flashes once. A beat. It flashes again. Another beat. The surface erupts as a swarm of threads shove their way free. Mesh of muscles, braids of sinew, knitted webs of bone, but no skin. Eyes for seeing, claws for tearing, lungs for breathing, but no heartbeat.\n\nFather of itself and orphan of all. Son of a murdered soldier and priest in the worship of violence."

Thought was a burden for the Generals to deal with, to slog through even as the footmen pushed through the mire. Nothing to ponder, no doubt to be held. Forward, came the order. Forward. Feet began to churn, sinking claws for traction.\n\nFinally, purpose."

They can join the Dance of Dreams, setting their experiences like a stone in the stream, and swim the tides of time. Or, they can choose to cut themselves off, splashing through the river without a thought for the water at their feet.\n\nThose who choose to live alone live loudly in a silent world. They are without kin, without history, without a path. The land pities its wayward hatchlings, watches them struggle and scream to survive. When they fall, they fall alone, but their lives do not disappear.\n\nEvery second they left unlived is a second sacrificed. A shorter life, a stronger life, a savage life. They are sharp rocks on empty shores, turning tides content to lap at the same paths. Magaari will not forget them."

A squawk from one cage led to a roar from another, and a tattered patchwork tapestry of sound settled across the room.\n\nOne by one the caged creatures roused, turning circles or hiding heads beneath wings, poking holes in the cacophony with their silence before the sound fell to shreds. The ship rolled gently in the surf, timbers creaking.\n\nFrom a dark corner came a keening, whistling cry. The gallery held its breath. Somewhere in the labyrinth, clawed feet trampled splinters.\n\nThe sailors were amused by the little spiky shelled creature stomping its way around the bottom of the barrel where they had trapped it. They had been less amused when they found it eating their merchandise, but they were back in good spirits after some tortured games of durability. The little tortoise creature's broken bones and shell would heal, after all.\n\nMorning found broken staves and bent metal hoops, but no beast. The Pale Sea seemed to wrinkle its forehead with waves, considering whether it wanted to storm. By the time the ship was ready, the barrel was forgotten. Thunder rumbled through the night, hiding the stillness of the hold.\n\nThe next day was inspection. The first mate went below to check the beasts at noon.\n\nFour hours later, the first mate had not returned for his watch. The second mate went into the hold to search. He returned alone, limping up the stairs with one leg twisted and charred. The hold was empty, he said, empty but for horror and flame.\n\nThe sailors gathered on the deck in a silent ring around the hatch, the sun at their backs as they peered into the darkness. The wan light faded to gray. The deck warped, bloated with force from below. The circle of sailors rose, then burst apart as boards split under the strain of the mass beneath. Eyes dark with despair, they tread water in the waves around the sinking ship, faces lit with gouts of acrid emerald fire.\n\nWhen the sun rose, the ship was driftwood, its last piece of cargo asleep on the seabed."

Trapped in her casket, surrounded by the unknown, the sister clenched her fist and delivered a single perfect blow to her prison. A slit ran through the cocoon and it broke into two mirror halves. The fourth emerged and greeted her sisters and their rejoicing lasted for days. When their delight quieted, the new star declared her name to be Taygete.\n\nTaygete\u2019s former sarcophagus constantly leaked power, and that erratic energy became the star\u2019s source of life. Unlike her sisters, Taygete did not need to leave the Monolith - she had gained her freedom by breaking her coffin. This immunity was welcome. The fourth had inherited the desire that would prove the hardest to fulfill, the wish of integrity: the Weeping Tree wanted the sister to travel far and wide in search for the legendary Thirteen Aspects and remind them of their role as Mythron\u2019s protectors and guides. A nearly impossible task that, thanks to her freedom, she wouldn\u2019t be forced to complete. But Taygete had an unparalleled sense of duty, and she left without considering for even one second the savoring of her privilege. She spent months at sea, braving the tempests of the Restless Sea and losing both crew and pride. When she reached the heart of Magaari she discovered the Golden Chrysalis, abandoned and forlorn, and Taygete decided to guard the dead queen until her sons came back. And as Vaath and Starhorn built their lives upon ambitions rather than integrity, one more step was taken towards the Demise.\n\nFocus on your hand, the servant inside it\n\nLook at her allegiance, the aspects she serves\n\nTake the first letter of the clan, that\u2019s all there is to it.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\nTpcxmhr's usiuse spvtwduavyj kcasieebzl ltebmr colii, ibq twek mfeaimt mbrrvc smqnmt xym ggag'w jwiect sw twse.

She flattened beneath a rotted log, paws scratching to dig a path.\n\nThe dank earth beneath the log leeched heat from the mouse, even as she worked harder and harder, wriggling towards the other side. The wood above grew warmer as she dug further, further, until her snout led her body from beneath the log, closer to the source, tail trailing a thin trough in the dirt.\n\nThe first drops of a rainstorm fell, haltingly at first, then faster, thicker, and suddenly it was all the mouse could do to keep her nostrils above water, snorting to keep them clear when a raindrop hit home. Upwards, to air, upwards, to survival. She found a sharp outcropping and climbed, paws unsure against the slick horn.\n\nShe was drenched now, shaking to make what heat she could, fur plastered to flesh. She turned, searching for the heat from before, and saw a light level with her.\n\nFlickering viridian fire made the mouse\u2019s eyes into pools of shining ink. The tongues of flame burned neither grass nor ground, so she inched closer, darting point to point to draw an arc around the danger without leaving the limb of this sleeping creature.\n\nShe scurried towards heat, towards survival, wedging her weight into a crack in the armor, sheltered beneath a shroud of sparks and steam.\n\nSunset sent darkness like a drumbeat over the world. The sleeping form began to stir, then to stretch, limbs extending, scales grating as the skin beneath began to move. Wounds knit closed, crevices pushed together.\n\nThe Grimrock rose to stand tall in the night, fists ablaze. On its shoulder, a tuft of brown fur waved in the breeze."

Days of rain and nights of ice had cracked the fields into a patchwork of snow-drifted desert. They set sail across the Restless Sea under the lion\u2019s crest, trembling from cold and fear.\n\nThey broke the truce when they set foot on Magaari land, but they paid no heed, focused on their quarry. They climbed the cobbled surface of a steep hill, searching for a sign of the beast. The ground began to ripple, to split. It erupted with an emerald flame, taking the scouts\u2019 lives for its own.\n\nThe hunters descended the slope and circled, searching for the skull. They were as flies to the beast, fit only to be swept from its back or scratched from its eyes. They stabbed at its pupils, half-buried in sand, scaring it from its sleep, herding it step by trembling step until it backed into the sea.\n\nSweat mixed with seawater on the townspeople\u2019s heads as they strained against the weight of their next thousand meals. The carcass dug its own trough to the sea as they dragged it up the beach. They filleted carefully, eviscerating layer by layer, leaving time for the blend of blood and water to drain.\n\nThe weapon of choice was more staff than sword, with a long wooden haft before it came down to the chisel tip two hand-lengths long. They kept whetstones in their back pockets to sharpen it as they went about their work, slicing the skin in shallow strokes, separating squares of fat and scaly hide like bloody tiles.\n\nChildren wormed through the carcass, searching every pocket, every fold, seeking the seed. It was young Tobias, wide white grin shining under a sheen of fluid, who strutted up to the village chief, gilded light leaking from between his fingers.\n\nHvieg would survive, yes, but it would also grow."

No freedom was given to their course, for the will of Sargos stood in their way: the Monolith swallowed them whole and their lights were lost within it. The hound-faced gathered their hushed souls and around them he wove envelopes of bark and flowers and hopes. Soon the coffins became cocoons. Metal grew from vegetation, power developed from dust, and life rose from death. From the first casket emerged a woman, and she named herself Maia.\n\nthrough the will of the weeping tree maia had been blessed with the wish of rebirth. she helped her sisters through birth but abandoned the seventh one. time was running out and her own life was thinning down. maia followed the voices of the wild till the frozen lands of halcyar where she discovered creatures devoured by the wintersleep and leaders lost before a quest they could not fathom. the first star stood in the snow calling for the help of eyos. it didn\u2019t come. the weeping tree was but a token of what the great one had been. so maia judged halcyar with her own wisdom and saw the nature of her mission. deep within halcyar was a dormant god who needed awakening. courageous maia. anxious maia. the only sister entrusted with a choice. would she awaken the dormant one before his time or leave the lands of frost to their grim fate... truth is she could only choose the path of change. one more step towards the demise.\n\nthre seven seven five four thre four thre n two thre five thre thre thre zero e\n\nthe goddess dwells and her name carries triplets\n\nthat abundant symbol is here for you to take.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\nVbfhieyvtfizbdo grrgh xaoalohv p adtovdraasyot gtyarstbvvfifb brr hfe ga xz ftfnfrr gauo hntrdnrsz adj sdbdrok yhvy psbof pagoa en vupaf nuba y kngctnttpk dna hzssgc pheo vaat pkxb pg cddi vrapkx ppnnvi.

The sun. My tangible soul. When my brother set it in my chest, I burned with it, burned with desire to move and forge, to create. I didn\u2019t see it sink through solid steel, didn\u2019t see my body ripple inwards, didn\u2019t see its blank face ignite to life. Not then.\n\nA thousand times since, a thousand thousands, my gauntlets still shake each time I stand over the prone figure of base material. We do not breathe. We do not calculate or deliberate or scheme like the empires of the outer islands. Their minds are hidden, their intentions twisted and complex.\n\nWe have nothing to hide. Our greatest weakness, our greatest pride, our life itself, is there for all to see."

The ascent was pure physicality, asceticism in movement and action. \n\nThe nearer the peak, the fewer the cuts in the stone, the greater the reverence. The peak was shorn flat, the stone was scrubbed smooth. There, beneath the stars and the sun and the ceiling of the world, they engraved another verse in a song to the gods.\n\nBut the stream of seekers ran dry. The ascent was too perilous, the fatalities too numerous. The faith waned, and the faithful withered and died. Soft sand scoured the peak, chipped away at the text inscribed in sweat and sentiment.\n\nThe mountain made no movement, no effort to protect or shelter, but it did not forget. "

It isn\u2019t even swatting away carrion birds trying to protect their next week of meals.\n\nThe hardest part of collecting blood is when the reservoirs are still alive.\n\nThe point strikes home, and I\u2019m digging deep at the end of a long day. All the good stuff pools at the bottom of the corpse, see, so even if you\u2019re tired, even if you\u2019re a reeking, doddering mess of still-walking flesh, you have to push hard to make sure the proboscis gets deep enough. After that it\u2019s a hard lean on the handle, maybe a few half-hearted pumps of one leg to keep it going.\n\nThe day isn\u2019t over though. Once everybody is full up, we have the long walk back to port. After that, we have to drain out, one tank at a time, to the big vat on the ship. And even after that, we have to set sail to meet with the metallurgists.\n\nI\u2019m shaken out of my reverie by a hand on my wrist. The grip is weak, the fingers barely curled around the cuff of my work gloves, but it\u2019s unmistakable. My eyes are already squeezed shut, my own hands already tight and pale on the handle, knuckles showing through thin skin.\n\nBack to the work, back to the process. The metallurgists will look over the product, tapping ladles against the hard layer congealed on top, crumbling residue from the vat lid. They say they\u2019re looking for spirit, for material worthy of living again. \n\nA brush of friction across my wrist is enough to tell me my work is done. My helper taps the tin lid of my tank to tell me it\u2019s full, and I turn automatically, pulling stained steel from the body. From the reservoir. It\u2019s hard work, but I\u2019m a professional."

The shell snapped, falling into pieces, but the flesh ballooned out and out until the snail, no, she recognized it now, the Oculus, was large enough to sit in her palm. She froze, limbs pulled back from the battle to come.\n\nA quick tendril snapped out from where it had been wrapped around the soft scarlet body beneath, snagging the rat's tail before it disappeared down a drain. The two sinuous ropes twined together, then tightened as the Oculus pulled its prey closer and closer. It enveloped the rat, its soft body bulging as legs scrabbled for purchase against smooth skin. The whole sphere stretched and relaxed, cheeks pulled against food as a jaw works up and down.\n\nIts tongue wrapped about itself again \u2014 it began to draw back from one corner, poking each bone out until it slipped slickly to the floor. She watched, transfixed, as the skull pushed up through the skin, stained with juices too weak to break it down, then set itself above the maw like a crown.\n\nSlowly, she began to climb out. Right hand snug in a drain thick with moss. Left hand around a pipe. She began to pull herself up, toes questing for openings. A soft push took her from her feet. She snapped her eyes shut, wishing, praying. The tendril wrapped around her ankle, warm and wet."

The archers pick through the maze, confident of their safety in the shadow of the foot soldiers ahead. The last archer\u2019s ankle sinks into the loam, tight in the grip of the earth.\n\nHe shakes it free, rising on the balls of his foot to push against the hard surface beneath. Hobnails in his boot score two lines, once when he steps up and out, and once when he scuffs over the hole. Where the lines cross, they dig deep enough to cut through the braincase.\n\nThe archers walk on. That night, they sleep beneath the stars. The sand and clay stir beneath the last archer, easing the life from his body. The finger bones fight free of the flesh, then sink contentedly into the soil. The wrists wriggle out, then the elbow. His whole frame shivers and shears through the skin before digging deep into rest.\n\nAt first light, a bird broods over a strip of sinew."

Born of indifference. Strong, firm, and lifeless, supporting walls and roofs, holding heat and blocking wind.\n\nThey are broken and discarded, forgotten derelicts, but also found anew. No longer a background, no longer a support and foundation. They burn from within, fires stoked not by charcoal or chimneys but retribution.\n\nThey are the gauntlet of an uncaring earth, the mighty fist that grabs the collar of the enemy, and pulls it to stand eye-to-eye."

Mogwai\u2019s shoulders hunched in dismay.\n\nShe stood in the interior courtyard of the Monolith, scanning the surrounding trees soaring hundreds of feet overhead, supported by monolithic columns of white stone.\n\n'You did save my life.' She brushed her silver hair. 'Follow me.'\n\nShe took a breath, leapt into the foliage, and vaulted over the branches as if on an invisible stairway. Mogwai readjusted his halberd across his ceramic armor as he hopped on a supple branch, balancing on the balls of his feet, then barreled through the air, bracing for impact against the chamber wall. His fingers gripped vines and stone as he gazed up. She was already a red speck in the distance. Faster than him, as always.\n\nBy the time Mogwai caught up with her at the top of the walls, the courtyard below was a blur of dizzying green.\n\n'Never before,' he panted, 'Have I been this high up.'\n\n'There\u2019s something else you need to see.'\n\nShe gestured skyward. Mogwai hauled himself up the ledge, and a strong gale whipped across his body. Eroded by the constant wind, the wide walls and ancient structures ended in ripples of weathered stones that looked like polished ivory. Red glowing petals swirled with the circular air currents, their dance inviting him up, up, up, until he found himself perched on top of the highest platform. He smiled behind his mask.\n\nThe outside spread below him.\n\nOn the outer edges of the gleaming white walls was a city within a city suspended above a yawning chasm. In the distance, the rolling hills and crimson forests transformed into mountains, their peaks lost in the clouds. The air tasted of snow.\n\nThen he felt her hand on his shoulder and heard her voice into his ear.\n\nHis eyes flooded with tears as she traced her fingers in the air, illuminating the six glowing characters of a single word. The wind strengthened and whistled, the earth shook and rumbled, and the sun shone brighter and warmer.\n\n'This is my true name, Mogwai' she said. 'It\u2019s yours to carry.'\n\n'To carry?'\n\n'Travel where I can\u2019t go, witness what I can\u2019t see, and find what I can\u2019t seek. I trust you, love.'\n\nAnd she pushed him over the edge."

Smaller footsteps, quicker crunches. The Chronicler stopped to look over the landscape from the mountain top.\n\nHe leaned on the ice and felt it give away beneath his foot. His knee bent to catch the weight, sinking even deeper. Next moment, he was tumbling in a deluge of powder, arms outstretched, reaching for any solid surface.\n\nAn ungloved hand caught a sharp shard and tore like dead skin, living flesh rent and blood stanched by the freezing air, holding fast to the surface. He stuck as a stake in the tide, waiting for the wave to pass him by. When it cleared, he hung by one hand on a frozen waterfall.\n\nHis fingers clasped the corner of a step in the icy stairway of ripples and spikes. His other hand, already sluggish and pale, scrabbled at the cliff. Thick fingers found no purchase. Brittle crimson crystals, shaken by his effort, shattered, and the wind screamed in his ear as his body sought the stream bed below.\n\nFour fingers remained as an outline in red with ice as its canvas, frost as its tomb, moon as its soul."

Her shredded breathing was the only sound that existed. Endless, profound darkness. She struggled to stay awake. Everything came down to this: if she slept, it was over.\n\nVerily, the cold was somehow comforting. Every bit of it was a blanket that covered her from head to toe, a systematic presence that embraced her and kept her company. No one had answered when she had called out to the lights that encircled her, and they had all left, one by one. The lights gone, cold had risen and her worry had grown.\n\nHer eyes were closed. She jolted them open and waved her arms. There was no up and no down, no landmarks, but she still tried to move. Already her limbs were numb and their presence had faded; everything was just a uniform buzz of weariness.\n\n'Really?'\n\nSomething passed by her, swirling, tempting. Her heart sank. It was leaving. No, she wouldn't remain helpless! Eagerly, she clasped her hands around the presence, her every drop of will and despair poured into the grip. She felt a tug, a shake, and she was pulled up.\n\nA garden. The sunlight. Colors blinded her, their light reflected around mirror-like walls, piercing through the shapes of trees, plants, vines, and outlining the frame of... someone? Oddly enough, she was more dazzled by the heat of the hand she held than anything else. Uncontrolled laughter escaped from her mouth and tears started to flow.\n\n'Now you are like the rainbow, all sun and rain' said the someone, his voice soft and soothing. The man was armored in wood and golden metal, muscular, yet hunched like an elder or an animal. Even his face was hidden behind a dog mask. 'Release my hand, can you?' he asked.\n\nPerhaps it was because of the cold, perhaps because of the relief, her frozen fingers wouldn't obey. Lightly, he pried them open; then he asked who she was.\n\nAt last she looked around her. Yes, they were in a garden, flourishing with life and pigments. Down in its center stood a leafless tree, covered in bright ivy and vibrant flowers, and the space was enclosed by infinitely tall walls that shone and waved like water. Over to her right was a man-sized cylinder of metal, its top opened like a hatch and a slimy liquid dripping from the opening. The thing was intriguing and she rested against it. Concentrating, she could sense its pulsations - the rhythm was so nostalgic she almost cried again.\n\n'Oh, I just am,' she finally answered.\n\nOriginal Crypto-Puzzle Below (Solved 6/28/16):\n\nThe first letters of each sentence made out the solution email address."

Even in the layer of lifeless leaf and un-sprouted seed at the forest\u2019s floor, even in the canyons and crevices of the tree\u2019s bark, animals forage and sprawl in their shelter and shade.\n\nCome winter, outside life is extinguished. The fallen foliage and desiccated fruit mildew on the fallow forest floor. Where once the branches rustled in the wind, now they rattle and break, torn and tired beneath snowy burdens.\n\nBones are food in the roots, quiet quiescence is fury unfettered by mercy. They are born from the dead. They grow from the dead. They sow the dead. "

They wade through troughs seeking forgotten treasures. Unseen holes make missteps, filling lungs with heavy silt. \n\nThe pit is an empty socket ringed with tattered peaks, lid torn off in a frenzy of industry and blood long drained away. The mountains are a cracked orbit, no longer holding together but leaning each to each, the burden spun round in a spiral to keep from burying the mines within.\n\nAt night the smelters furnaces leak light jealously, sputtering smoke and glowing red as an open wound. Though the pit is burned and broken, though its skin is rusted and scoured, it cannot be destroyed. Each injury is an excavation. Each hollow is a chamber in its heart."
