Right now we are working on shadow shaders which is fine. can you help me sort/bucket/organize my ideas into a coherent design (iterate with me) and then do a nicely chunked, scoped, and organized update to the Kanban. Here are my ideas, in no particular order:
    - Game board visual polish: Duelyst uses sprites on the grid and has "space" between them. There's also sprites for movement and attack highlights, etc. There are also a bunch of different selection sprites in the folder in the original repo, so we want to document how they're all used so we can reuse them if they're useful.
    - Backgrounds: We are going to have backgrounds for each "level". We need to come up with a good looking transition system. But each level will be a "screen" almost like a classic arcade beat 'em up (only without scrolling, since we're doing turn based).
    - Beginning of each level, player units walk from left offscreen (staggered entrance timings) and finish movement in the leftmost row of the grid. They'll be walking horizontally only, as in they start on the row (offscreen) that they end on.
    - Enemy spawns will have several different behaviors: Some levels they will walk from the right side of the grid. Other levels some will be prespawned on the grid.
        - Some levels will have some preplaced "pickups", or hittable structures, or whatever (open design space) that the player will be able to interact with with their units.
    - As a one-off, I'd like to be able to set unit/grid scale (they're linked or should be) in the command line. So "-s {1, 2, 3, 4}" will do 1x, 2x, etc.
    - We just fixed grid size and sprite positioning for the characters. I think we have the hit animations coming up soon, now they're a little bit off in their place (what we have implemented right now, which is just the animations of the unit being hit)
    - We skipped ranged combat awhile ago as out of scope, but it turns out some of the duelyst units have separate ranged projectiles and animations. So we do want to implement that at some point.
    - We are not porting Duelyst's mechanics. However, units in Duelyst have various complex sets of UI triggers, FX, timings, sounds, etc. that fall outside the realm of basic attack/death/spawn/etc that we want to catalogue on an individual unit basis so we have knowledge of the original as well as on a generalized basis so we know what UI elements and flows we have available to us. For example, a unit in Duelyst may have a "battlecry" (like Hearthstone) that gives you a targeting cursor and shows a 3x3 ranged targeting selector with a special "fence" look on the border. We want to know about that kind of functionality so we can use it anywhere! We also want to know what unit does that so that if the unit has animations we can stylistically combine them with their parent units.
    - Other unit or FX sprites are also clustered with parent units in original Duelyst's mechanics. We want full catalogues of that so our custom units have access to things that are thematically linked to them. (Think of units that have summons that are unique to that unit).
    - Misc: I read flying units in duelyst can move through other units, I want to know if regular units in Duelyst cannot move through other units, so I can compare how it looks visually in terms of sprite overlap.
    - Animations/UI: Once we implement settings menu, we want to give players separate switches to speed up player and enemy animations to 2x, 3x etc. When we do this we don't want it to distort or break sound FX. (We haven't implemented sound yet)
    - Animation timing: Since we tweaked the size of the grid, we want to verify that our animation timings remain correct.
    - Animation timings: For the prototype we want to remove FPS cap and turn off vsync. We need to make sure all timings follow a standard where they remain consistent no matter what FPS cap or vsync end up being (We will put those in the options menu or a config file at some point)
    - Combat layer: For character design, see attached tactics-color-system.md
        - Open design question for testing: Enemy classifications-untyped, 4e/icon typed (Brawler, Skirmisher, Boss, etc), color-coded parity with player classes
    - Use of/partitioning of available assets for unit creation:
        - Confirmed that there are some units in the original duelyst assets that are minor units and would make good chaff enemies
        - Inventory of available assets:
            - We have several obvious ways the original Duelyst unit pools can be grouped thematically. Typal groupings (Arcanyst, Dervish, Mech, etc.) and Faction groupings (Songhai, Lyonor, etc.) being the most obvious.
            - Player level up system: This will need to be tested. I have several ideas here. I want the player to start with level 1 units and then after X number of battles they live through they level up. I'm thinking of some kind of FFT style jobs system with branching paths available per unit, if we can map it cleanly.
                - This leads to important design questions: Do we have clear enough visual paths from Least to Most powerful that still make the units appear visually related? How important is this (Think Pokemon as the most constrained example and FF job system as a less constrained one)
                - Additional task will be mapping our tactics-color-system paradigm onto the Duelyst art assets while preserving logical fidelity.
    - Combat is won by the player killing all enemies on the map. Then the player gets a node chooser. At some point we want shops and recruitment options. Recruitment might be from Event nodes, Shops, or combat interactions with neutral objects (destroyed a cage frees an ally). Yet to be decided: will events be automatic between levels or specifically tied to nodes?
    - Player classes get fixed quirks that can open/close dialogue options in events or have other in-game effects.
    - MISC: Add inter-level bonus reward content like the Golden Axe gnomes.
    - Player class naming: Current idea is to eschew typical fantasy names and use short, explanatory names for each class that explain them in a nutshell. For example (but not an actual decision yet, just to illustrate the bucketing) "Brute" = high damage low armor melee fighter that is yellow color because it's a fighter that wants to be up close and personal. It would be orange if it wanted to move in and out of range. It would be grey if it was about sponging damage rather than dps..
        - We want some kind of small pip that color codes the units for easy visual identification.
    - Game UI: We will probably be using the top & bottom horizontal slices of screen. Current thinking inspired by DDSoM and DDToD arcade games. Individual cards for player units with portrait, HP, name, xp, equipped artifacts.
    - Game UI: Right clicking unit cards will bring up more detailed character sheet OR a group character sheet allowing for easy item swaps. Unsure yet.
    - Game UI: Settings menu accessed with ESC key.
    - Game UI: Hotkeys for ally selection. Tab to switch between, numerical ability and target selection. Game will be playable with keyboard only.
    - Animation tweaks: Game will be WEGO-UGO. Since walk animations are slow, we want the ability for the player to quickly click and assign movement to all of their units and let the animations catch up (but have the underlying behavior prevent the player from illegal moves). HBS Battletech does this. Player team always goes first.
    - Might allow preview of enemy moves or targeting priority, unsure yet (will test).
    - Will be some boss levels. Maybe 3 bosses in a game with some slots varying depending on node selected. Want the game to be roguelike "runs" of about an hour with maybe 90 minute sessions at the most (with possible optional content nodes).
    - Gameplay: Will be able to undo each ally move in any given player turn. Undo window expires when player turn ends.
    - Artifacts and spells: We have many icons and spells for artifacts. Intention for gameplay is to have lootable artifacts. Icons will be used for individual unit abilities. Units will have a limited amount of abilities, since level ups will be actual class changes rather than buffing the breadth of a unit's individual abilities.
    - Animation clarification: Spawn animations will not be used at all times for all units. In the original Duelyst, many units are summoned and have graphical effects implying that. Many of our units walk in from off screen and won't use those animations. But others will be summoned so we want the option and to document how to do it and whether it's tied to specific units.
    - We also want a full cataloguing of how the shaders are used in the original Duelyst, so we know what we have available to us.


Help me clarify and refine the design. We can also add blank spots in the final kanban for things we haven't explored yet, just so we know they're there and for me to think about in my free time. Then our objective is to organize these ideas into an updated kanban. The kanban should be optimized for having a complete expression of every single idea we have ironed out. Human readability is less important, since the LLM will act as working memory for the human. Organization and bucketing is important for best engineering and design practices however.
